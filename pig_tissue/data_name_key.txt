-- Pig tissue study--
- N1 = base library phage exposed to uninjured pig tissue and gelatin coated slides
- b3 = domain antiody library, amplified 3x
- NP1 = negative positive screen. negative library phage exposed to gelatin, uninjured, and then injured pig tissue
- NP2 = NP1 library phage exposed to gelatin, uninjured, and then injured pig tissue
- NP3 = NP2 library phage exposed to gelatin, uninjured, and then injured pig tissue
